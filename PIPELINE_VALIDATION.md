## 🔍 Advanced Features Validated

### Database Query Capabilities
```bash
# Agent-specific filtering
GET /events?source_app=web-dev-agent          → 4 events
GET /events?source_app=data-science-agent     → 4 events  
GET /events?source_app=devops-agent           → 4 events

# Event type filtering
GET /events?event_type=Stop                   → 3 events
GET /events?event_type=PreToolUse             → 3 events

# Text search functionality
GET /events?search=terraform                  → 1 event
GET /events?search=success                    → 6 events
```

### Real-Time Capabilities

## 🎯 Next Steps for Live Demonstration

1. **Start Multiple Agent Sessions**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Web Development Agent
   cd agent-projects/web-ecommerce-platform && claude --resume
   
   # Terminal 2: Data Science Agent  
   cd agent-projects/data-science-analytics && claude --resume
   
   # Terminal 3: DevOps Agent
   cd agent-projects/devops-infrastructure && claude --resume
   ```

2. **Monitor Real-Time Events**:
   - API: `http://localhost:4000/events/recent`
   - WebSocket: `ws://localhost:4000`
   - Database: SQLite at `apps/data-processing/events.db`

3. **Demonstrate Cross-Agent Workflows**:
