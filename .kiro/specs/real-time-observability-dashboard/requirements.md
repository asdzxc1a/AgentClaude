# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the Multi-Agent Observability System by implementing real-time WebSocket broadcasting and a comprehensive Vue 3 dashboard. The system will provide live monitoring of multiple concurrent Claude Code agents through an intuitive web interface with real-time event streaming, advanced filtering, and interactive visualizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor multiple Claude Code agents in real-time through a web dashboard, so that I can track agent activities, performance metrics, and coordination patterns as they happen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to the data processing server
2. WHEN new events are captured from any agent THEN the dashboard SHALL display them within 100ms
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect with exponential backoff
4. WHEN multiple agents are active simultaneously THEN the dashboard SHALL display events from all agents in real-time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter and search through agent events dynamically, so that I can focus on specific agents, event types, or time periods without losing real-time updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a source app filter THEN the system SHALL show only events from that specific agent
2. WHEN I select an event type filter THEN the system SHALL display only events of that type
3. WHEN I enter a search term THEN the system SHALL filter events containing that text in real-time
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN new incoming events SHALL be filtered automatically
5. WHEN I clear all filters THEN the system SHALL return to showing all events

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to visualize agent activity patterns through interactive charts, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks, coordination issues, and usage trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a real-time timeline chart of event frequency
2. WHEN events occur THEN the charts SHALL update smoothly without flickering or performance degradation
3. WHEN I hover over chart elements THEN the system SHALL show detailed event information
4. WHEN multiple agents are active THEN the charts SHALL distinguish between different agent sources
5. WHEN the time window exceeds display capacity THEN the system SHALL implement time-bucketed aggregation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to monitor dangerous command attempts and security violations, so that I can ensure agent operations remain safe and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dangerous command is blocked THEN the system SHALL highlight the event with a warning indicator
2. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about what was blocked
3. WHEN viewing security events THEN the system SHALL show the original command and the reason for blocking
4. WHEN multiple security events occur THEN the system SHALL aggregate and summarize the threats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to track agent execution metrics and resource usage, so that I can optimize agent performance and identify resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents execute tools THEN the system SHALL display execution time metrics
2. WHEN viewing performance data THEN the system SHALL show average, min, and max execution times
3. WHEN resource usage is high THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators
4. WHEN comparing agents THEN the system SHALL show relative performance metrics
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL highlight concerning trends

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the dashboard to be responsive and accessible, so that it can be used effectively across different devices and by users with varying accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL adapt to smaller screen sizes
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the layout SHALL adjust smoothly
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline indicators and graceful degradation
