# Multi-Agent Observability Demonstration Projects

This directory contains three realistic projects designed to demonstrate the Multi-Agent Observability System in action. Each project represents a different domain where multiple Claude Code agents would work simultaneously, generating observable events for real-time monitoring and coordination.

## üåê Agent 1: Modern Web Application (ReactJS + Node.js)
**Project**: E-commerce platform with microservices architecture
**Focus**: Frontend development, API integration, database operations, testing
**Typical Tasks**: Component development, API endpoints, database migrations, unit tests

## üìä Agent 2: Data Science & Analytics (Python + Jupyter)
**Project**: Financial market analysis and anomaly detection
**Focus**: Data processing, machine learning, visualization, statistical analysis
**Typical Tasks**: Data cleaning, model training, report generation, data visualization

## üöÄ Agent 3: DevOps & Infrastructure (Docker + Kubernetes + Terraform)
**Project**: Cloud infrastructure automation and deployment pipeline
**Focus**: Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, CI/CD, monitoring
**Typical Tasks**: Docker builds, Kubernetes deployments, Terraform planning, pipeline automation

## üîß Multi-Agent Coordination Scenarios

### Scenario 1: End-to-End Feature Development
1. **Web Agent**: Creates new product listing component
2. **Data Agent**: Analyzes product performance metrics
3. **DevOps Agent**: Deploys feature to staging environment
4. **Observability**: Tracks cross-agent coordination and dependencies

### Scenario 2: Production Issue Response
1. **DevOps Agent**: Detects performance anomaly
2. **Data Agent**: Analyzes error patterns and user impact
3. **Web Agent**: Implements hotfix and testing
4. **Observability**: Monitors response time and collaboration efficiency

### Scenario 3: Data Pipeline Development
1. **Data Agent**: Develops new ML model
2. **DevOps Agent**: Containerizes and orchestrates model serving
3. **Web Agent**: Creates dashboard for model predictions
4. **Observability**: Tracks resource usage and performance across agents

## üìà Observable Events Generated

Each agent project is configured to capture:
- **PreToolUse**: Command validation and security checks
- **PostToolUse**: Execution results and performance metrics
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Task requests and context
- **Notification**: Status updates and alerts
- **Stop/SubagentStop**: Task completion and handoffs

## üîç Monitoring Dashboard

The Data Processing Agent provides real-time visualization of:
- Agent activity timelines
- Cross-agent dependencies and handoffs
- Performance metrics and bottlenecks
- Security violations and blocked commands
- Resource utilization across projects
